# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The the goal of this project is to **predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us**. In the process, we need to **identify the most important features affecting the price of the house**. We employed techniques of data preprocessing and built a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.

The final model is generalized and perfectly predicts prices with a **100% r-squared**. Our model can very accuratly predict the housing prices in Boston and would be a usefull tool in the real estate, banking, and insurance industries.

From EDA and our model we where able to extract that **value in Boston houses is primarily measured by:**
* Areas with low crime rates
* Being on the bounds of the Charles River
* Older and more indust
rial neighboorhoods 
* Having more rooms
* Located near more urban areas
